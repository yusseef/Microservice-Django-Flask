# Microservice app (Django / Flask / Docker / RabbitMQ)

The microservice app consists of two services: one built using Django and the other built using Flask. The Django service is responsible for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to products. This includes creating new products, retrieving existing products, updating product information, and deleting products.

The Flask service is focused on allowing users to "like" products. This involves creating a route that enables users to submit a "like" request for a particular product. The Flask service would then update the product's "like" count accordingly.

Together, these two services work in tandem to create a simple microservice app that enables users to manage products and interact with them in a meaningful way.

## Features

- Product CRUD operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete product information using the Django service.
-  Like feature: Users can like a product using the Flask service, which updates the product's like count.
- Microservice architecture: The app is built using a microservice architecture, which allows for scalability, modularity, and flexibility.
- Django framework: The Django service is built using the Django web framework, which provides a robust set of tools and features for building web applications.
- Flask framework: The Flask service is built using the Flask micro web framework, which provides a lightweight and flexible approach to building web applications.
- RESTful API: Both services likely expose RESTful APIs, which make it easy for other applications to consume the app's functionality.
- Database integration: Both services likely integrate with a database, such as PostgreSQL to store and retrieve product information.
